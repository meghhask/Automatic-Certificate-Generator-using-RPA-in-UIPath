# Automatic-Certificate-Generator-using-RPA-in-UIPath
A mini project on Automatic Certificate Generator using RPA in UIPath. This project allows users to generate mass certificates of same format taking template from word and data from the excel sheet. This project also sends the certificates to the respective participants taking their mail ids from the excel sheet. It is very fast and easy to use and responsive too!



Note 1: Add the server and mail id along with the password to send the certificates online to the participants.
Note 2: If mailing is not required, then remove the 'Send SMTP mail message' activity.
